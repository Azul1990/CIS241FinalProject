	<p>CIS 241 Web Development I is my very first coding class ever. While it was fascinating to finally see and learn how web pages are built, it was also hard and challenging to memorize all the code. 
	Also, I understood that coding is paying attention to details because missing an ‘s’ at the end of the link will not allow you to reach that page (Learned it the hard way).
	I know it may sound like this class was hard for me, but I think that is how everybody feels when they try something for the first time. Right! 
</p><p>For the “ah ha” moments, well it is hard to choose one as everything was new for me, but I think the most useful one is the external CSS that allows applying style to the whole website at one time. 
 Doing the project competency allowed me to practice, make mistakes, learn from them, and simply reinforce what we learned. I enjoyed experimenting with the features and just saw that I am taking my first steps as a web developer.   
Now that I know the basics of web development, I can say I am ready to practice what I learned in this class and keep learning from all the resources out there.
